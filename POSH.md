## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes unwelcome behaviours of a sexual nature such as:

- Inappropriate comments, jokes, gestures, or messages.
- Unwanted touching, staring, or physical proximity.
- Repeated requests for dates despite rejection.
- Displaying sexually explicit images or content.

These behaviours can be verbal, non-verbal, physical, or digital and can occur in any workplace setting.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would:

- **Stay calm and document the incident** clearly (what happened, when, where, and who was involved).
- **Report the incident** to the Internal Committee (IC) or the designated PoSH officer in the organization, as per the procedure in the MountBlue PoSH policy.
- **Support the victim** if I am a witness, and encourage them to report it formally.
- **Avoid retaliation** and maintain confidentiality during the inquiry.
- **Cooperate with investigations** and help maintain a safe, respectful work environment.
