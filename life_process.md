# Learning Process

## Question 1  
**What is the Feynman Technique?**  
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you try to explain a concept in simple terms as if teaching it to someone else.

## Question 2  
**In the TED talk by Barbara Oakley, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most interesting idea was how Barbara Oakley, someone who initially struggled with math, retrained her brain using different learning strategies—proving that anyone can learn anything with the right approach and effort.

## Question 3  
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

- **Active Mode (Focused Mode):**  
  A concentrated and intense way of thinking where your brain uses already established neural connections to solve problems.

- **Diffused Mode:**  
  A relaxed thinking state where your brain explores broader ideas, helping in creative problem-solving and gaining insight when you're stuck.

## Question 4  
**According to the video "Learn Anything in 20 Hours", what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**

1. Deconstruct the skill — Break it down into smaller parts.  
2. Learn enough to self-correct — Don’t try to learn everything at once.  
3. Remove barriers to practice — Eliminate distractions.  
4. Practice at least 20 hours — Focused, consistent practice.

## Question 5  
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

- Use the Feynman Technique to test my understanding by explaining concepts in my own words.  
- Alternate between focused (active) and relaxed (diffused) thinking to improve retention.  
- Deconstruct complex topics into manageable parts and practice them individually.  
- Set clear, short-term learning goals and allocate time using deadlines effectively.  
- Block distractions during learning time (social media, notifications).  
- Track time and productivity using tools like Boosted.  
- Always relate the concept to its real-world use or code implementation.  
- Treat learning as a joyful, creative activity instead of a task.  
- Make the concept my own — use examples, analogies, and custom code.  
- Regularly review and teach others to reinforce my own understanding.  
- Communicate clearly and ask for help proactively when stuck.
