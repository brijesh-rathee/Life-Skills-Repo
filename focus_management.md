- Frequent breaks and rest are crucial to maintain quality and avoid burnout.

## 7. Intentionally Creating Diffused Mode

**Diffused Mode** is when your brain is relaxed and not actively working on a problem, allowing subconscious processing.

### Activities that promote diffused mode:

- Meditation
- Walking without devices
- Standing/sitting/lying in silence

These practices improve creativity, reduce mental fatigue, and prepare your mind for deeper focus.

## 8. Getting Started on Difficult Tasks (Overcoming Procrastination)

Procrastination often stems from **emotional avoidance** (fear, boredom, frustration).

### 3-Step Technique:

1. **Work for just 30 seconds.**
2. **Take a short break.**
3. **Affirm your ability**:
   - "This task is hard but I am capable."
   - "This is boring but I can handle it."

Repeat the cycle and **gradually increase work duration**. This builds momentum and shifts identity from "avoider" to "doer."
