# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits - Reflections & Learnings

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

### Q1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most compelling idea was how BJ Fogg emphasized that starting with something incredibly small — like doing just **one push-up** — can lead to major behavioral change. He explained that it’s not about motivation but about creating a system where the habit is so tiny, it’s hard to say no. This idea reshaped my view of discipline — it’s not about doing more, but starting small and building consistency.

### Q2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

B = MAP stands for **Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt**.

- **M (Motivation)**: Your desire or willingness to do the task.
- **A (Ability)**: How easy or simple the task is to perform.
- **P (Prompt)**: The trigger or signal that reminds you to act.

To form a new habit, don’t depend on high motivation. Instead:
- Reduce the effort (increase ability),
- Add a strong prompt (tie it to something you already do),
- And keep it so simple you can’t fail.

### Q3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebration creates a **positive emotional connection** with the habit. Even a small cheer or smile sends a reward signal to your brain. It tells your brain, *“This felt good. Let’s do it again.”* This emotional reinforcement is key to making a habit stick, especially in the early stages.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day 

### Q4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The idea that stood out was how small improvements, done consistently, compound into significant progress over time. The video explained how being **1% better every day** can make you 37 times better in a year. That perspective really motivated me. It’s not about drastic change overnight, but small daily progress that adds up.

## 4. Atomic Habits Book Summary

### Q5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book highlights that the most powerful way to build a lasting habit is by tying it to your identity. Don’t just aim for goals like "I want to read more." Instead, think: *“I am a reader.”* When your actions align with the person you believe you are, habits feel natural and effortless. This shifts behavior from being task-based to being identity-driven.

### Q6: How to make a habit easier to do?

James Clear recommends making habits easier by:
- **Applying the 2-minute rule**: Start with a version of the habit that takes under 2 minutes.
- **Simplifying the environment**: Put everything you need within reach.
- **Reducing friction**: Prepare things ahead of time, like setting out your clothes if you want to exercise in the morning.

### Q7: How to make a habit harder to do?

To break a bad habit, increase its difficulty by:
- Making the **cue invisible** (e.g., remove snacks from sight),
- Making it inconvenient (e.g., log out of social media apps),
- Associating it with a **negative emotion** or loss,
- Replacing it with a more beneficial habit.

## 5. Reflection

### Q8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps to make it easier?

**Habit**: Reading before bed.

**Steps**:
- Keep a book on my pillow as a visual cue.
- Start with just 2 pages per night to make it easy.
- Use a warm reading light to make the environment inviting.
- Feel proud of staying consistent (say “Good job” after reading).

### Q9: Pick one habit that you would like to do less of. What are the steps to make it harder?

**Habit**: Checking my phone in the morning right after waking up.

**Steps**:
- Keep my phone outside the bedroom (remove the cue).
- Use a physical alarm clock instead.
- Make the morning routine more engaging (stretching, journaling).
- Reflect on how screen time first thing drains my energy (make the response unsatisfying).
