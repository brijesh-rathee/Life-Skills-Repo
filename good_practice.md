# Good Practices for Software Development - Review

## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- The recommendation to **use Loom, Github Gists, Codepen, or Codesandbox** for asking questions and sharing setups was new and insightful.
- The idea of **joining meetings 5–10 minutes early** to build rapport and improve team communication was a fresh and useful tip.
- The suggestion to **bundle all your questions in one message** instead of sending multiple scattered messages was a new and thoughtful practice.
- Emphasis on **over-communication in group chats instead of private DMs** to keep transparency and involve more eyes on the issue was a valuable reminder.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

### Area of Improvement:
**"Doing things with 100% involvement"** — maintaining deep focus during work sessions.

### Ideas to Make Progress:
- Implement the **“Deep Work”** principles by allocating fixed distraction-free time slots each day.
- Use the **Boosted app** to track my work hours and analyze focus patterns.
- **Silence the phone and disable non-work notifications** during work hours.
- Use tools like **TimeLimit or Freedom** to block distracting websites and apps.
- Improve daily energy and focus by:
  - Having **balanced meals** (avoiding heavy or insufficient food intake).
  - Including **at least 30 minutes of exercise** in my daily routine (e.g., home workout or walking).
